#This is The Simple Chat App  Simple But Most Useful in Learning Context  I think !!!. The App Name is ChatRoom

    This app use Firebase Firestore DataBase as a medium for collect Text messages and display to the device screen

    in the firebase firestore  created one collection of documents called << messages >> 

    the user can send new data (as Text messages) to the messages collection 

    and user also can retrive that data through subscribing to a Stream of Snapshots, the snapshots contain Collection of Documents

But ......!

    before doing that things we need to create new user or login existing user  

    in this App user have 2 choice options 

        1st one is Login OR register user Via Email And Password

        2nd one is SignIN with google
